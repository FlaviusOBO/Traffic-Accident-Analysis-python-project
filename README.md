# Traffic-Accident-Analysis-python-project
In today's world, road safety remains a critical concern, with traffic accidents being a leading  cause of injuries and fatalities. To mitigate the impact of accidents, it is important to understand  patterns and trends in traffic incidents.
Project Scenario: 
The objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing traffic accident information collected over the past year. This dataset includes variables such as accident location, time of day, weather conditions, vehicle types involved, severity of accidents, and the number of injuries or fatalities. The primary goal is to identify recurring patterns in traffic accidents and predict the risk of future accidents under different conditions. 
Accident Data Variables: 
• Accident Location: Various regions within the city or highways. 
• Time of Day: Specific times when accidents occur (morning, afternoon, evening, or 
night). 
• Weather Conditions: Whether the accident took place under clear, rainy, foggy, snowy, or windy conditions. 
• Vehicle Type: The type of vehicle involved (car, truck, motorcycle, bus, bicycle). 
• Accident Severity: The severity of the accident (minor, moderate, severe). 
• Traffic Density: The traffic level at the time of the accident (low, medium, high). 
• Accident Hour: The hour during which the accident occurred. 
• Injuries and Fatalities: The number of injuries or fatalities involved in the accident. 
With this dataset, traffic accident risk prediction will be implemented by analyzing accident hotspots, identifying high-risk factors, and forecasting when and where accidents are most 
likely to happen. The predictions could potentially help optimize the allocation of resources, inform policy-making, and improve public awareness programs.
